It was the first the three really embraced a cappella. The show required groups to have five or more members, so they recruited bass vocalist Avi Kaplan and singer/beat boxer Kevin Olusola. Grassi skipped high school graduation to audition for 2011’s The Sing Off. After they won, all relocated to Los Angeles to pursue recording artist careers. The main goal of the group was to become the first modern mainstream a cappella group; which they have done.</p><h2>Mitch Grassi Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mitch Grassi is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Mitch Grassi</b>'s net worth <strong>$8 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was attracted to performing on stage and began his involvement in local music theater as a child.</p><p align=justify>He wants to pursue a career as a music producer and hopes to one day become a professional DJ and musician.&nbsp;He co-owns a YouTube channel called “sup3rfruit” with Pentatonix member&nbsp;He is in pursuit of a career in music production with ambitions to become a professional electronic musician and DJ. He runs a popular YouTube channel called sup3rfruit with fellow Pentatonix member <a href=#>Scott Hoying</a>..</p><p align=justify>Mitchell “Mitch” Coby Michael Grassi was born (1992-07-24 ) July 24, 1992 in Arlington, Texas, to Nel Grassi (née Fenton) and Hornell native, Michael Grassi. The couple relocated to the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas area in the mid-1980s for Mike’s career in the airline industry; Nel is a dental hygienist educator. Grassi has an older sister, Jessa, and remembers doing singalongs to then-current pop tunes and Christmas songs in homemade variety shows with her, for his parents when he was very young. His uncle Tony was also “a high tenor and had an incredible range”. He met Scott Hoying, another co-founder of Pentatonix, and his partner in the duo Superfruit, when he was young. He also met Kirstin Maldonado, another Pentatonix founder, when he was nine or ten and they were both doing musical theater. Grassi and Hoying were both active in theater arts in Arlington and met when they were cast in the musical Annie, they both also play piano. They were “giggly” together but not best friends immediately; they then were split up being sent to different schools for a year and a half, and reunited while performing in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Though both were still closeted at the time, they feel they had a subconscious connection, as well as their musical theater interests; Grassi’s favorite Broadway musical is Rent. When he was fourteen, Grassi knew he wanted to be a singer and musician, “I want to enrich others’ lives with the music I make, because that’s what music did for me all my life.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Grassi and Scott Hoying, lifelong friends, vlogged skits, comedy videos, and duets to YouTube quickly gaining a following; after hundreds of videos they saw the music ones were the most liked so created Superfruit. Some of their viral videos include: Frozen medley (with more than thirteen million views as of April 2016) ; an “Evolution of Miley Cyrus” (12.8 million) and a Beyoncé album medley (with over twelve million). According to Hoying, Superfruit “came from Mitch’s random mind”. Hoying noted, “Our first rule with starting Superfruit was: This is for fun, … This is to be free and do whatever we want. So, let’s write stories that we want to write, let’s make videos that we want to make, let’s not put limitations on it. And not care so much about calculating it to where we think it might be more successful … And I think that’s why it feels so good to the fans.” The first Superfruit video was released on August 13, 2013. Navigating Pentatonix versus the duo’s projects and touring schedules was simplified by the quintet’s rule that the larger groups’ commitments come first. Grassi feels Superfruit is raunchier, “more gay-friendly and a lot more open, more sexual, more liberated”.</p><p>They continually release YouTube videos, with nearly every one with more than a million views. They also tour extensively including across North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America—over an estimated forty countries as of December 2016; and have had cameos in shows and movies like Bones and Pitch Perfect 2 (2015); and their own television show, A Pentatonix Christmas Special (2016).</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mitch Grassi height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Mitch <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Pentatonix is a quintet a cappella collective, with most of their songs being covers, and much of their success comes from touring, including internationally. They gained national attention in the U.S. competing on NBC’s a cappella reality show The Sing-Off in 2011, which they won. The group got a record label, who dropped them as their audience was too niche—with no guarantee of selling albums, or concert tickets—but Grassi felt it was ultimately advantageous as around late 2012 Pentatonix started posting videos to YouTube building an international fan base. Pentatonix also released the debut EP, PTX, Volume 1, on their new label in June 2012, followed by a Christmas EP, PTXmas in November. They recorded covers of pop 40 hits like Gotye’s “Somebody That I Used to Know” (2011), Psy’s “Gangnam Style” (2012), and Fun’s “We Are Young” (2011). Their big video hit was a November 2013 video doing a medley of Daft Punk songs, it had ten million views in the first week of its release and rose to over 150 million views; as of January 2020 it has over 320 million views.</p><p align=justify>The individual members find inspiration to cover recent songs, as well as international classics, then if they decide as a group it is a good match, they compose an arrangement; their friend Ben Bram, who is also their producer, is their co-arranger. Grassi is influenced by electronic music; his dream mentor, and single biggest influence is Imogen Heap. Although they are known for their covers and re-arranged popular songs, the band released their first album, Pentatonix, in October 2015, and it was all original music; it also marked the first time an a capella group had the top album on the Billboard 200 album chart. Their sold-out North American tour that year was documented in the movie, On My Way Home. Grassi noted he and Hoying both being openly gay has been appreciated by the group’s fans; a common demographic is midwesterners and Christians who comment that the pair have helped them accept their LGBTQ children.</p><h2>Who is Mitch Grassi Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mitch Grassi</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
