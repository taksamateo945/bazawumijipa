The Minnesota Timberwolves chose Bullock with the 42nd overall choice in the 1999 NBA draught. As time passed, Bullock found himself on the receiving end of a cash deal from the Timberwolves to the Orlando Magic.</p><p>Even yet, Magic released him before the start of the season. Thus, Bullock could not suit up for even a single NBA contest. But Louis Bullock played his professional career in a handful of European leagues.</p><p>Lou’s first professional deal was with the Italian team Muller Verona, who talks about his professional career. In 1999–2000, he was a member of Verona’s roster.</p><p>The next day, Bullock made his professional debut for a losing cause against Virtus Roma, 84-76. Then, on March 19, 2000, against Milano, Louis Bullock scored 46 points.</p><p>Bullock then collected a career-high nine rebounds in a 113-100 loss to Montecatini Terme on the 20th of February, 2001. Bullock averaged 22 points per game while playing for Verona in the Euro League, with a 41% clip from beyond the arc. He finished as the Euro League’s fifth-best scorer despite being a rookie. By 2001, Bullock had made it onto the first team of the All-Euro League.</p><p>Bullock played for Unicaja for the next two seasons in the Italian League. In Bullock’s first year with Milano, he averaged 24.9 points per game and led the Italian League in scoring.</p><p>However, in 2002, Bullock joined Unicaja Malaga of the Spanish ACB League.

Bullock scored 15.0 points per game while shooting 51.5% from deep in just ten contests. In the Euro League, he led Malaga in scoring with 14.4 points per game.</p><p>Bullock also became a fan favorite at Malaga as he contributed to the club’s two straight seasons in the Europa League.

Although he did not start with the football club, he had an immediate impression on Real Madrid and contributed to the club’s several championships.</p><p>Bullock joined the Madrid squad as a shooting guard but was quickly converted to point guard. Bullock’s abilities with the ball and his vision helped him much in his new position.</p><p>On December 19th, 2004, against BAXI Manresa, Bullock scored a season-high 35 points while dishing out five assists in an 85-83 victory. Against Lugo, Bullock had the highest assist total of his career with eight on March 12th, 2005. Later in the ACB finals, Lou was named the tournament’s most valuable player. Bullock scored 86 points throughout five games, with 11 coming in a must-win fifth game on June 27 against TD Systems Baskonia.</p><p>The following year, Bullock won the 2007 Euro Cup and the Spanish league championship. On April 10th, 2007, the Bullock-led team defeated the Rytas Vilnius team by 75–87. Bullock averaged 13 points per game and shot 37.6 percent from deep throughout the tournament.</p><p>In addition, he hurt his hand while playing for the Estudiantes in the ACB League. Fortunately, he was attended to promptly by medical personnel after sustaining his wound.</p><p>In addition, the American played with Real Madrid for three more seasons before leaving in the summer of 2010. Nonetheless, he left Madrid, having earned the team’s and its supporters’ respect. His skill and personality on the field won over the supporters of Madrid.</p><p>Bullock later signed a one-year contract with Spanish team CB Cajasol Sevilla for the 2010-11 season.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Louis Bullock Retirement&nbsp;</h3><p>According to an interview with the club, Bullock was signed by Asefa Estudiantes in April of 2012.
