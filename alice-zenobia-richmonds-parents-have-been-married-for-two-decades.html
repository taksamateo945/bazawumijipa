Aside from her acting roles, Alice is well-known as the older daughter of actors Jeff Richmond and Tina Fey. Alice has worked on a few projects so far and has made her own name for herself, rising above the star kid label.</p><p>Jeff and Tina’s older daughter is in her adolescence. As a result, many of her fans are curious to know if Alice has already started dating. However, she has not yet disclosed her marital status. Furthermore, her parents are reluctant to discuss their children in the media.</p><p>So, in this article, we’ll talk about Alice’s childhood, relationship with her parents, love life, and other topics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alice-Zenobia-Richmon-1.jpg><h2>Alice Zenobia Richmond Biography</h2><p>On September 10, 2005, Alice Zenobia Richmond was born to her father Jeff Richmond and mother Tina Fey. People reported the birth of the SNL stars’ first child at the time, stating that the baby girl weighed 5 lbs and 7 oz. At the time of her birth, Alice’s mother was 35 and her father was 44.</p><p>Alice was named after her maternal grandmother, Zenobia “Jeanne” Xenakes. Donald Fey is her maternal grandfather. Similarly, Wayne Richmond and Blanche Richmond are Alice’s paternal grandparents.</p><p>Jeff, the SNL host, had announced the birth of her first child in April of that year. Despite being pregnant with Alice, she continued to present on the show until the season finale on May 21.</p><p>Alice is a U.S. citizen. Her mother’s side of the family is English, German, Irish, and Scottish.</p><h2>Alice Zenobia Richmond Has An Older Sister</h2><p>Alice received a wonderful gift from her parents more than five years after she was born. And she is none other than Penelope Athena Richmond, her younger sister. Penelope was born on August 10, 2011.</p><p>The nine-year-old girl has already established herself in the world of acting. She made her television debut in the 2015 series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Penelope made an appearance on the musical Girls5eva in 2021.</p><h2>Alice Zenobia Richmond Acting Works</h2><p>Richmond’s first acting job was when she was about seven years old. In 2012, she starred in 30 Rock as Liz, a seven-year-old girl. A One-Time Special, a TV special that aired nearly eight years later, featured Alice as herself.</p><h2>Alice Zenobia Richmond’s Parents Have Been Married For Two Decades</h2><p>As of 2021, Alice’s parents have been in a happy marriage for more than two decades. Furthermore, the couple has been dating for over 27 years, beginning in 1994. Jeff and Tina married in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on June 3, 2001.</p><p>According to People, the couple dated for more than seven years before getting married. They allegedly met while both were students at Second City. They quickly became friends and began dating. Their affair quickly developed into a serious relationship.</p><p>Because of the disparity in their heights, they drew a lot of attention to themselves in the early stages of their relationship. Tina is 5 ft 4 inches tall, while her husband, Jeff, is only 5 ft. Regardless of their physical differences, they have created an adorable couple out of themselves. And their love for one another has only grown stronger over the course of their 27-year relationship.</p><h2>Alice Zenobia Richmond’s Mother Got Slashed On The Face</h2><p>If you’ve been following Tina Fey for a while, you may have noticed a small scar on the left side of her chin and cheek. For a long time, the actress had kept the reason for the large scar hidden. She only told Vanity Fair about it in 2009. She later revealed it in her autobiographical book as well.</p><p>Tina told the outlet that a stranger slashed her in the face in the alley behind her house during her spring semester of kindergarten.</p><h2>Alice Zenobia Richmond Net Worth</h2><p>Alice Zenobia Richmond, who is only 15 years old, is still discovering her passion for acting. By far, she has only made two minor appearances on television series, both of which could have paid her well. Her exact payment, however, is not disclosed. Furthermore, her net worth has yet to be revealed.</p><p>In the meantime, both of her parents are well-known actors. Tina Fey, her mother, is a multi-millionaire with a net worth of $75 million. Her father, Jeff Richmond, on the other hand, is a millionaire with a net worth of $3 million.</p><p>When it comes to real estate, the husband and wife spent $3.4 million on an apartment on New York City’s Upper West Side. Similarly, the couple paid a whopping $9.508 million for a co-operative apartment in New York in January 2016.</p><p>The apartment is approximately 3,000 square feet in size and has 3-4 bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms. According to the variety, the apartment is directly above the previously mentioned similarly sized apartment.</p><h2>She Doesn’t Use Social Media</h2><p>Alice Richmond will turn 16 in September of this year, but she has yet to develop an interest in social media. It’s unusual for a star kid who has already made his acting debut to be absent from social media. Her parents, in fact, do not engage in social media sharing of their lives.</p><p>Meanwhile, as of 2021, the Instagram account “tina fey official” has around 48k followers. The account is unverified, and its bio reads, “I am an actress.” Interestingly, the account was opened on January 2, 2014, and it does not appear to be active since that date. The user, if not Tina herself, shared 13 posts on the day the account was created, and since then, not a single post has been shared.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYpaGTmnq7sc2omaKZXae2pLTMqKWdq12lrrOxza2qZqCRq7JursSepWalkae%2FqrHDZp2oql2pxLB5w56ampyVqHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falice-zenobia-richmonds-parents-have-been-married-for-two-decades.html&text=Alice%20Zenobia%20Richmonds%20Parents%20Have%20Been%20Married%20For%20Two%20Decades&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falice-zenobia-richmonds-parents-have-been-married-for-two-decades.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falice-zenobia-richmonds-parents-have-been-married-for-two-decades.html&title=Alice%20Zenobia%20Richmonds%20Parents%20Have%20Been%20Married%20For%20Two%20Decades" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falice-zenobia-richmonds-parents-have-been-married-for-two-decades.html&title=Alice%20Zenobia%20Richmonds%20Parents%20Have%20Been%20Married%20For%20Two%20Decades" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falice-zenobia-richmonds-parents-have-been-married-for-two-decades.html&title=Alice%20Zenobia%20Richmonds%20Parents%20Have%20Been%20Married%20For%20Two%20Decades" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falice-zenobia-richmonds-parents-have-been-married-for-two-decades.html&description=Alice%20Zenobia%20Richmonds%20Parents%20Have%20Been%20Married%20For%20Two%20Decades" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-login-to-smile-network-or-contact-customer-care-for-help.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How To Login To Smile Network Or Contact Customer Care For Help">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./thalia-matos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Thalia Matos Age, Bio, Career, Net Worth, TikTok IG">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
