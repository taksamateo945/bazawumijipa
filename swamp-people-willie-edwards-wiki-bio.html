Besides hunting the famous reality TV star of the “<strong>Swamp People</strong>”. He is a key flag bearer of the Edwards’ family.</p><p>In this article, we will explore the star’s wife, wiki-bio and his net worth. His body measurements are also discussed below.</p><h2><strong>Wiki/Bio</strong></h2><p>According to his wiki sources, Willie Edwards’s parents are Junior Edwards and Theresa Edwards. Willie’s real name at birth was William Edwards. Currently, the TV star has his residence in Louisiana. Louisiana is found on the Gulf of Mexico although it’s one of the southeastern U.S. states.</p><p>The reality star has a younger sibling brother by the name Randy Edwards. Unlike many other people, Willie Edwards got his early training from his father. He was taught specifically on how to hunt and survival techniques in Louisiana.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-5342 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebliveupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Willie-Edwards-parents.jpg alt="Image of Willie Edwards with his father (Junior Edwards) and mother (Theresa. Edwards)" width=600 height=563 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The reality star is an American national of the white ethnicity.</p><p>The star once accidentally broke one of his teeth while playing blindfold in the house. Luckily for him, a Robinson Dental Group’s office assistant saw his tooth gap and offered to help. Willie agreed, and he was helped to get full set of teeth.</p><p>The American star’s education background has not been disclosed yet. This remains among his other secrets which he has kept close to his chest.</p><h2><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Willie Edward’s career kicked off in the crafts of fishing and hunting. This was just what his father was doing, his father was, therefore, his great mentor and trainer.</p><p>The reality star with his father made an appearance in the TV on&nbsp;22&nbsp;August 2010. This was in the “<strong>Swamp People</strong>” show which aired in the History Channel.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-5343 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebliveupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Willie-Edwards-profession.jpg alt="Image of Willie Edwards from Swamp People show" width=600 height=337 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Willie Edward’s first appearance received the highest ratings ever from the viewers. However, Junior Edwards left the show in its 7th season. This left Willie Edwards as the only representative of the Edwards’ family in the show.</p><p>The Edwards’ family is accredited for bringing great freshness in the show. It also gave the show a youthful outlook that had not been there.</p><p>“<strong>Swamp People</strong>” was a show that brought together numerous stars. Some of them included&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Jacob Landry</a></strong>,&nbsp;Jay Paul Molinere,&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Troy Landry</a></strong> and Tommy Chauvin. Other legendary hunters in the show were Junior Edwards, and Theresa Edwards.</p><p>It appears the American star decided to take up his father’s role. This is because he went on to perfect his skills in the hunting of alligator, fishes, and crabs. This he did in the swamps of South Louisiana.</p><h2><strong>Willie Edwards Wife, Married, Children</strong></h2><p>Willie Edwards is married to his wife, Sherrie Edwards. The couple is blessed with three children. They have a daughter called Michaela Edwards.

In one of his Facebook posts, he is seen with his children, the sons, in a swamp. Willie Edwards was probably trying to teach them how to hunt.</p><p>Details on when the two lovers met or when they got married have remained scanty to date.</p><p>The American star and his family currently live in Bayou Sorrel, Louisiana. Here, they can make full use of the swamp’s myriad resources. They do their alligator fishing in this swamp.</p><h2><strong>Willie Edwards Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Willie Edwards has a net worth of $500 000.
