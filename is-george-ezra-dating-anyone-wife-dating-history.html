He has never been married either. Ezra launched his first album “Wanted on Voyage” in 2014, after the success of his song “Budapest,” which reached at number one in the UK.</p><p>His second album, “Staying at Tamara’s,” debuted at number one in the United Kingdom and went on to become the second-best-selling album of 2018. In September 2022, Ezra released his third album, “Gold Rush Kid,” and embarked on a UK and Ireland arena tour. Beginning October 21, the singer will embark on a worldwide tour that will take her to Dubai, Sydney, Perth, Melbourne, and Auckland.</p><h2>Florrie Arnold has been in a relationship with George Ezra for three years.</h2><p>In 2017,<strong> George Ezra started dating Florrie Arnold</strong>, full name Florence Arnold, a fellow British pop artist. The couple met three or four months before his second album’s last track, “Staying At Tamara’s.” As a result of his less hectic schedule, the singer was able to spend a lot of time with Florrie.&nbsp;Throughout their relationship, George and Florrie worked hard to keep their romance quiet, making just a few public appearances together. The duo made their relationship public at the 2019 Brit Awards, where Ezra received the British Male Solo Artist award for his album “Staying At Tamara’s.”</p><p>They didn’t walk the red carpet together at the Brit Awards. They did, however, sit near one other and were seen kissing and snuggling by several admirers. Unfortunately, the beautiful pair chose to separate ways peacefully in 2020, before the lockdown. Before the separation, they were living together in London. The award-winning musician said that being alone during the lockdown was difficult for him. The renowned musician expressed how alienated he felt in a podcast titled “Phone A Friend,” stating, “I felt it slipping in. ‘What’s that?’ it asked. Oh, you’re feeling a little lonely.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/George-Ezra.jpg alt="George Ezra" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Budapest singer claimed that his second album’s song “Paradise” was inspired by the early stages of their relationship.
