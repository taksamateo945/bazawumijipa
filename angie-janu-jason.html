Similarly, the American actor <a href=#><strong>Jason Beghe</strong> </a>and his ex-wife <strong>Angie Janu</strong> have a similar story. The couple was supposed to be in each other’s lives until death, but the story had something else written in their fate.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Here, in this article, we try to provide you insights into their relationship and separation. Also, please get to know Jason Beghe’s ex-wife, Angie Janu, and her age right here.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who is Angie Janu? Biography</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Angie Janu is famously known as a model and an actress who is not so deeply rooted in the entertainment industry. Besides, her name is mentioned as an ex-wife of Jason Beghe. As Silvia talks about her acting career, Angie can be best known for her role in Too Good to Be True.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How old is Angie Janu? Age and Birthday</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Angie might be in her late fifties right now, as her IMDb claims that she was born in the mid-1960s. Unfortunately, we could not precisely tell how old the actress is since there is no revealed information. As far as we know, she was born in the United States and had American Nationality. But besides this, there is nothing much left to know about her parents and family.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Angie Janu and Jason Beghe Married Life</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Angie and Jason fell in love and dated for quite some years before their marriage. However, it is not known when and where they met for the first time. The couple walked down their wedding aisle in February 2000. They had quite a private wedding ceremony with no media exposure. Some of their close friends and family witnessed their wedding where they had promised to be each other’s support system until death.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The duo even shares two beautiful children, both sons, named&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bix Beghe</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bo Beghe</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, who are 14 and 11 years old, respectively. However, after being married for seventeen years, their relationship came to an end, and they parted ways in 2017.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4964 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jason-Beghe-Ex-wife-Angie-Janu.jpg alt="Angie Janu smiling with her ex-husband jason" width=593 height=534 sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-4964 class=wp-caption-text>Model Angie Janu and her Ex-husband, Jason Beghe</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Angie Janu and Jason Beghe divorced after 20 years</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Angie and Jason had many ups and downs in their relationship during those seventeen years. Hence, even after the long-term marital relationship, Jason filed the divorce in 2017. The exact cause&nbsp;for their divorce remains a mystery, as Jason characterizes it as a difference of opinion and incompatibility, while Angie avoids confronting it.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, Angie was quite frightened about her husband’s decision to leave Scientology. Their family, especially kids, was time and again threatened and was followed to school after Jason left the church and publicly criticized the church. Jason also<a href=#> confronted</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;that he and his wife had already separated back in May 2016, but their official separation was dated September 28, 2020. They finally put their single tag on that day. Following the divorce, they came up with some negotiations regarding their properties.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to TMZ, Jason will reside in a Chicago, Illinois condo, whereas Angie will reside in Malibu, California. Similarly, they share physical and joint legal custody of their two sons, but Angie will be care-taking their children while Jason will be on his work.

Nonetheless, Angie has been featured in some wiki-bio pages and has an&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>IMDb</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;profile where you can get a few insights. She hasn’t been much active in her career for many years. According to her bio, the last project she was involved in was the TV series, Chicago P.D. where she played Camille Voight in 2016.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So far as we are concerned about Janu’s career, we found out that she started as a model. She kept all her focus on modeling for different agencies and Ad-films. Later, her career status upgraded as she was offered Too Good to Be True. Even though her role in the movie was much celebrated, we could not see any significant progress in her career later. Furthermore, her part in the TV series Chicago P.D. in 2016 did not raise her fame and uplift her career.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4963 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Angie-Janu-image.jpg alt="Angie Janu looking beautiful in casual look" width=634 height=612 sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-4963 class=wp-caption-text>Model Angie Janu</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Net Worth and Salary</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>We have mentioned earlier that Janu’s acting career was not as successful as her ex-husband Jason Beghe’s. Hence, we cannot expect her to have a huge net worth from her career. A&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>source</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;claimed that her net worth is estimated to&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>be $1.5 million</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. We assume she might have made this fortune by her career as an actress and model.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>We should note that she did work as a model in different Hollywood companies based on glamor. So, all those hard work might have paid her back, and she is undoubtedly living a lavish life on her own even after the divorce. Meanwhile, her ex-husband, Jason, reportedly has a net worth of&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>$9 million</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Angie Janu ex-husband Jason Beghe</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Angie’s ex-husband Jason Beghe has achieved immense fame and career progression in his life. The actor was born on March 12, 1960, so he is 61 years at the moment. He is one promising actor in the United States and has given super hit movies like Compromising Positions, JAG, G.I Jane, Lie To Me, The X-Files, X-men, Chicago Justice, and many more.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Besides, in 1986, he also appeared in the TV series Dress Grey, in Hank Beaumont’s role. His work and projects cannot be easily named as he has&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>103 credits</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;just as an actor. Furthermore, we can also recognize him as a producer of Pale City, which he produced in 2018.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4965 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/angie-janu-ex-husband-jason-baghe.jpg alt="Angi Janu's husband, Jason Baghe" width=717 height=553 sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-4965 class=wp-caption-text>The famous actor, Jason Baghe</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCgnZ5jsLC5jpqloKGVYreiutRmoZqrn6N8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fangie-janu-jason.html&text=Angie%20Janu%20%28Jason%20Beghe%20Ex-Wife%29%20Age%2c%20Biography%2c%20Wikipedia&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fangie-janu-jason.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fangie-janu-jason.html&title=Angie%20Janu%20%28Jason%20Beghe%20Ex-Wife%29%20Age%2c%20Biography%2c%20Wikipedia" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fangie-janu-jason.html&title=Angie%20Janu%20%28Jason%20Beghe%20Ex-Wife%29%20Age%2c%20Biography%2c%20Wikipedia" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fangie-janu-jason.html&title=Angie%20Janu%20%28Jason%20Beghe%20Ex-Wife%29%20Age%2c%20Biography%2c%20Wikipedia" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fangie-janu-jason.html&description=Angie%20Janu%20%28Jason%20Beghe%20Ex-Wife%29%20Age%2c%20Biography%2c%20Wikipedia" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./firefighter-marques-hudson-died-while-saving-lifes-of-others.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Firefighter Marques Hudson Died While Saving Lifes of Others">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./where-is-sharon-tate-buried.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Is Sharon Tate Buried?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
